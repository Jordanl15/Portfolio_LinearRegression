# Simple Linear Regression Analysis Tool

# STILL IN PROGRESS

This Python script performs linear regression analysis on a dataset provided in a CSV file and visualizes the data along with the line of best fit.
All formulas that were chosen were based on my current math course.

## Features:
- **CSV Data Input**: Accepts CSV files containing x and y coordinate data.
- **Header Handling**: Allows users to specify whether the CSV file contains headers or not.
- **Linear Regression Calculation**: Calculates the slope (b), intercept (a), correlation coefficient (r), coefficient of determination (rÂ²), standard error (se), and predicted values.
- **Visualization**: Plots the original data points, the line of best fit, and any predicted values using Matplotlib.

## Instructions:
1. **Input Data**: Prepare your dataset in a CSV file format. Each row should represent a data point with two values: x and y coordinates.
2. **Run the Script**: Execute the Python script .
3. **Follow Prompts**: Answer whether your CSV file has headers, provide an x value for prediction, and specify if you want to predict more values.
4. **View Results**: The script will display the line of best fit, original data points, and any predicted values graphically.

## Requirements:
- Python 3.9
- Matplotlib
- NumPy

## Usage:
1. Clone the repository or download the script.
2. Install the required dependencies (`matplotlib` and `numpy`).
3. Run the script and follow the prompts.
