Linear Regression Analysis Tool
This Python script performs linear regression analysis on a dataset provided in a CSV file and visualizes the data along with the line of best fit.

Features:
CSV Data Input: Accepts CSV files containing x and y coordinate data.
Header Handling: Allows users to specify whether the CSV file contains headers or not.
Linear Regression Calculation: Calculates the slope (b), intercept (a), correlation coefficient (r), coefficient of determination (rÂ²), standard error (se), and predicted values.
Visualization: Plots the original data points, the line of best fit, and any predicted values using Matplotlib.
Instructions:
Input Data: Prepare your dataset in a CSV file format. Each row should represent a data point with two values: x and y coordinates.
Run the Script: Execute the Python script linear_regression_analysis.py.
Follow Prompts: Answer whether your CSV file has headers, provide an x value for prediction, and specify if you want to predict more values.
View Results: The script will display the line of best fit, original data points, and any predicted values graphically.
Requirements:
Python 3.9
Matplotlib
NumPy
Note:
Ensure that your CSV file is correctly formatted with numerical data only besides headers.
This script assumes a simple linear relationship between the x and y variables.
